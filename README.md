# Health Insurance Cost Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project utilizes **Machine Learning** to predict health insurance costs based on various factors such as age, BMI, smoking habits, and other demographic details. The model is trained on a dataset and provides an estimated insurance cost based on user input.

## Features

- Predicts health insurance costs based on user inputs.
- Uses regression models for accurate predictions.
- Data visualization for better insights.
- GUI interface for easy interaction.

## Requirements

Ensure you have Python installed (Python 3.x recommended). Install the required dependencies using:

```sh
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn tkinter
```



## How It Works

1. Enter the required details (age, BMI, smoker status, etc.).
2. Click **Predict Cost** to get an estimated insurance cost.
3. View graphical representations of data trends.

Dependencies
- `pandas` - Data handling and preprocessing.
- `numpy` - Numerical computations.
- `scikit-learn` - Machine Learning models.
- `matplotlib` & `seaborn` - Data visualization.
